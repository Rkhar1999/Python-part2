    "   - \\( P(X = 3) = 0.551 \\): About 55% of passengers are in 3rd class.\n",

    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "- **Pclass** is treated as a **random variable** that takes values \\( 1, 2, \\) or \\( 3 \\).\n",
    "- We calculate the probability of each class by dividing its count by the total number of passengers.\n",
    "- This probability distribution helps us understand the likelihood of a passenger being in each class.\n",
